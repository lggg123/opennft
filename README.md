# openNFT

Welcome to openNFT, a comprehensive platform (or tool, library, etc.) for exploring, creating, and managing Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) on the blockchain. I created this from scratch using Go Gin React TypeScript and Python creating a GAN which I will train soon. I just need to connect it now to the backend.

## Introduction

I created a openNFT dApp that uploads images to be trained by a GAN I am still trying to tie into the application and also I have a text input field to help create NFTs based on text input.

## Features

List the key features of your project. For example:

- Feature 1: Image Uploader to train GAN.
- Feature 2: NFT image creator tool.
- Feature 3: NFT minter

## Getting Started

clone the repo by typing `git clone https://github.com/lggg123/opennft`

### Prerequisites

Make sure to have Go installed and gin as well. Also make sure to have Node.js installed the proper version for this.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running.

## Usage

This is a go application and a react application. To begin the go application simply type `cd backend/src` type `go run .` then the backend should be running.

To run the frontend as well type `cd ..` then type `cd ..` then type `cd frontend` then type `npm start`
